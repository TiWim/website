# HowTo Write OpenChange Server Backend in Python #

[TOC]

# Introduction #

Initially designed with C backends development in mind, the pluggable
backend system of OpenChange has evolved. It now provides a consistent
python interface every developers can use to write new storage
backends very quickly through a C-Python gateway. The primary
objective - while not necessarily out of scope - is not high
performances or scalability but to leverage Python
capabilities. Python provides a development environment adapted for
quick design with web services without trimming features and
capabilities.


# Purpose and Scope #

storage abstraction layer, required understanding of MAPI concepts and
be able to start writing your own python backend for OpenChange
server.
