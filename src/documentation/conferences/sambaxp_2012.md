OpenChange 1.0 is now out and its Borgs start assimilating other
services. Through its storage service named MAPIStore and its SOGo
groupware backend, OpenChange can now transparently open Outlook users
world to a wide range or reliable Unix services such as IMAP, SMTP and
database servers.


This talk will highlight and demonstrate many of the exciting 1.0
features OpenChange provides and how it can interoperate with existing
IT infrastructures.

In the last part of this talk, we will focus on OpenChange future and
experimental features designed to extend its development community and
promote adoption.
