This presentation introduces OpenChangeSim, a MAPI stress testing tool
leveraging OpenChange client libraries to generate MAPI traffic from
multiple and unique IP addresses. The presentation first describes the
objectives of this approach, then the challenges we faced with
Exchange protocols automation. The last part of the presentation
focuses on getting started with the tool: configuration, deployment,
system logs and known limitations.
