have a good Warp engine. Similarly, competing with Microsoft Exchange
requires OpenChange to develop a robust, reliable and extensible
server.

This presentation first provides a quick status update on OpenChange
and its MAPI library. It next focuses on OpenChange server design and
architecture. The talk finally concludes with a live demonstration of
the server running with Microsoft Outlook and what can be expected
from OpenChange within next months.
