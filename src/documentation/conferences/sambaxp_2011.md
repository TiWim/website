### Abstract ###

<h2>Growing up healthy - the OpenChange test environment </h2>
<div class="date">May 9th - 11th, 2011</div>

OpenChange is a FOSS implementation of the Exchange RPC protocols,
providing interoperability with unmodified Microsoft Outlook clients
and Microsoft Exchange servers. OpenChange is is a major user of
Samba4 functionality, from memory allocation and DCE/RPC libraries
through to the Samba 4 directory store.

OpenChange developers have a strong commitment to testing, and this
talk will discuss what we've tried, what worked (and didn't work) for
us and why that might be, and some plans for the near future. The talk
will cover both client and server testing as well as other
products. It will cover both manual and automated tests.

It will also cover a little bit of test philosophy, including why you
might like to think of testing as a measure of product health rather
than just as a way to find bugs.

This talk will be of value to those with an interest in OpenChange,
Samba4 applications, or whole-of-product testing,

Brad Hards is a member of the OpenChange core team, with a particular
focus on testing.

## Title: OpenChange MAPIStore distributed storage ##

- May 9th-11th 2011 (Goettingen)

### Abstract ###

<div class="news" style="width:90%;">
<h2>OpenChange MAPIStore distributed storage </h2>
<div class="date">May 9th - 11th, 2011</div>

With OpenCHange and its MAPIStore storage mechanism, users can
aggregate data from multiple services and servers and transparently
access them through their Microsoft Outlook interface.

Imagine you can have your Inbox, Outboux and Sent Items folders
accessing a remote IMAP server, that your Contact folder fetches your
contacts from your Facebook account, that your calendar is stored on
Google Calendar or that your Sticky Notes are turned into tweets.

That is what OpenChange MAPIStore is about and what we will be
discussed along with Outlook-OpenChange server demonstrations.
