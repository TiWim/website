<div class="date">May 13th - 16th, 2014</div>

In 2004 OpenChange was a few lines of code and no plan at all, and it
might have all stopped there. Over the next decade OpenChange slowly
gathered a contributor community and decided on a full implementation
of MAPI, client and server. 

Today in 2014, although there is plenty of enginering and polish to
complete, this goal has been achieved. Microsoft clients and servers
operate with full functionality against OpenChange without being able
to tell the difference.

But what should come next? This talk explains the kinds of interesting
and new things that can be done when you implement the world's most
popular groupware solution in open source code.
