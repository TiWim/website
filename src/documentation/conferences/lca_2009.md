upon a time, in a land called KDE, there lived a bunch of happy
hackers. Every so often, they looked over to the neighbouring lands of
the Evil Empire, and saw the masses who would come to the free and
open lands of KDE, if only the masses could unshackle themselves from
the chains of Microsoft Exchange.

Then one day, a couple of hackers from the lands of KDE found a small
enclave of hackers in a land called OpenChange. OpenChange was close
to the kingdom of Samba, where good king Tridge presided. Amongst the
fine works of OpenChange and Samba, there was a big sign saying
"Exchange compatibility this way". And the KDE hackers rejoiced, for
it was good (if a little rough around the edges).

Come along to:
- understand how the introduction of Akonadi in KDE 4.1 enables the
  easy development of Groupware clients, without having to write all
  that tricky network code yourself;
- find out how OpenChange libraries allow access to Exchange servers
  using native protocols ("as seen in Outlook");
- and see how Akonadi and OpenChange are used together to allow KDE4
  groupware clients to access Exchange servers.
