OpenChange MAPI client library 1.0 baptised BORG will soon be released
and will provide full-features and complete access to Microsoft
Exchange Server from UNIX platforms: email, calendar, contacts,
address book, tasks, notes or public folders. This library has been a
long time coming but is finally on the right track, feature complete,
and intended to be used in production environments. The first part of
the presentation will provide an overview of existing libmapi
applications - graphical or console based - and focuses on visual
demonstrations.

However OpenChange does not only supply client-side MAPI
capabilities. The server side is also in progress and aims to provide
a transparent Exchange server replacement based upon Samba4. The last
part of this demonstration will focus on OpenChange server design, how
it uses Samba4 infrastructure and its current development status.
