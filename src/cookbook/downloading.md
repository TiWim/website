# Benefits of compiling the source #

Several distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, SuSE and Fedora) contain
packages for OpenChange. These packages are not maintained by the
OpenChange team but by the distributions, and may be out of
date. Also, the OpenChange project is moving along quickly and you may
want to evaluate or benefit from latest features, changes and bug
fixes we may supply in the future.

# Getting Source Code #

OpenChange master repository is only available through git. The
repository can be found at [git://git.openchange.org/openchange.git](git://git.openchange.org/openchange.git)

    $ git clone git://git.openchange.org/openchange.git

# Next: Build the code #

You now have a complete copy of the OpenChange codebase. Continue on to [building the source](/cookbook/building.html)
