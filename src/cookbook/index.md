# Getting Started #

This guide provides a step by step guide aiming at deploying a fully
functional OpenChange server from sources within your environment. 

To start this cookbook, proceed to [Initializing
section](/cookbook/initializing.html)

If you prefer saving some time, you can use nightly builds packages for
Debian/Ubuntu RHEL5/6 or CentOS rather than building from sources.

To use packages, proceed to the [Download
section](/download/index.html) first and adapt the cookbook reading
accordingly.
