**The OpenChange project team is proud to announce the release of
OpenChange 2.0 QUADRANT.** 
<br><br/>
OpenChange is free software, and is the only drop-in replacement for
Microsoft Exchange.

<br>

## Drop-in Compatibility for Microsoft Exchange ##

The OpenChange team has created the first and only compatible Free
Software implementation of Microsoft's Exchange protocols used by
Microsoft Outlook and compatible clients.

OpenChange runs as a service on top of Samba 4.0 Active Directory
compatible server and provides Exchange connectivity to all MAPI
compatible clients. The immediate benefit of OpenChange server is:

**No plugin required for Microsoft Outlook**

Another key feature of OpenChange lies in its capability to plug into
existing infrastructure and makes use of existing reliable
services. OpenChange makes use of your existing messaging server to
transmit (Postfix, Exim4) and deliver (Cyrus SASL or Dovecot)
emails. Regarding common groupware objects such as tasks, appointments
and notes, they are stored in your database server (PostgreSQL,
MySQL).

OpenChange server also provides support for Outlook Anywhere, formely
known as RPC over HTTP. This service allows clients using Microsoft
Outlook to connect to their Exchange servers from outside the corporate
network.

## Perfect software combination ##

The best of OpenChange server and its SOGo backend can be obtained
using the following set of softwares.

Software   | Version
---------- | -------
OpenChange | 2.0 QUADRANT
Samba      | 4.0.1
SOGo       | 2.0.4

## New Features ##

- Outlook AnyWhere (RPC over HTTP) support in OpenChange server
- NTLM automatic negotiation for RoH clients
- AutoDiscovery service implementation "AutoDiscovery Publishing
  Lookup Protocol Specification"
- Ability to provision user accounts on Samba servers that are domain members
- Ability to deprovision openchange schema from Samba4
- Auto provisioning of mailboxes upon first authenticated client connection
- Auto provisioning of FreeBusy data for the user

## Improvements ##

- IDL structure renamed to match MS specifications more closely
- support for double type
- move/copy folder support
- cached mode support improvement (FXICS)

## Known Issues with SOGo backend ##

- If you can't see any email's content with Microsoft Outlook 2007,
  install the latest Service Pack available from Microsoft's website
  for this specific version. Microsoft Outlook 2007 (12.0.6423.100)
  SP2 MSO (12.0.6425.1000) is known to work.

- When you create a new Microsoft Outlook profile, not all folders
  might be synchronized during the first start. Simply select the
  appropriate folder and click “Send and Receive”. Synchronizing a
  folder may take some time. For example, a folder with 1000 email
  messages might take around 5 minutes based on the underlying
  hardware.

- Errors when synchronizing the *Offline Address Book* are normal and
  can be ignored for now. This feature is currently not supported.

- If you face strange issues from Microsoft Outlook, you might want to
remove any data associated with the user from the SOGo server and
recreate a Microsoft Outlook profile.  To remove any data associated
to a user, use the openchange_cleanup.py script distributed with
sogo. The script can be found in `/usr/share/doc/sogo/`
(`/usr/share/sogo-VERSION/` on `RHEL`).  To reset a user, run the
script as root: `python openchange_cleanup.py username`.  See the
usage output for additional options.

- The *Out of Office Assistant* will not currently work. This feature
  has not been implemented.

- Creating folders below INBOX (when not normally permitted by the
IMAP server), below the Personal Calendar or Personal Address Book
will work in Outlook cached mode but the server- side operation will
fail and these folders will never be created. Potentially data loss
can occur if the Outlook profile is destroyed. If you wan to create
additional top-level mail folders, calendars or address books, open
Outlook's folder list, select the top level node (usually,
*email@example.com*) and choose *New Folder...* from the contextual
menu. Choose the relevent item types.

- Sharing mail folders is not supported

- Labels will not work in Calendar

- Tasks with start/due dates created from Outlook might not appear correctly in SOGo due to a timezone issue.

- Task Reminders are not yet supported.

- Assigning tasks will not work.

- Categories will not work.

- Distribution lists will not work.

- Under Microsoft Outlook 2010, the special folder *Suggested Contacts* will not work.

- The *Offline Address Book* will not work. This feature is not yet supported.

- Notes are not synchronized in any ways with SOGo. The current
version of SOGo lacks support for notes.


## Benefits of SOGo collaboration ##

OpenChange server and SOGo ( [http://www.sogo.nu](http://www.sogo.nu) )
are both groupware servers sharing mutual interest in collaborating
for the greatest benefits of end users. The cement of this cooperation
lies in a backend developed by Inverse Inc on top of OpenChange API
that plugs SOGo storage to OpenChange server through SOGo
libraries. From a general perspective, it can be described as:

* OpenChange uses SOGo libraries to store Outlook data
* SOGo uses OpenChange to serve Outlook clients

In practice, it means that users primarily interested in an Exchange
compatible server interoparable with Microsoft Outlook clients don't
need anything but Samba4 and OpenChange. There is no need to run SOGo
server.

In the meanwhile, as soon as users are looking for Webmail access,
synchronization with Mozilla Thunderbird/Lighning, Apple iPhone or
Blackberry, then SOGo server is needed.


## Opening Linux Desktop to Exchange World ##

OpenChange is also providing client libraries and series of tools
allowing users to connect to Microsoft Exchange and Compatible servers
such as OpenChange from Linux Desktop. A quick introduction to usual
openchange tools is available from the Web site in the documentation
section.
