A new release of the MAPI library is now available for download. The
ROMULUS codename refers to Romulan homeworld (ch'Rihan). It took no
less than 10 months and 600 commits to the OpenChange starship to
stopover this planet, but it finally reached its destination.

OpenChange command crew however thinks a warp engine control would be
necessary and decided to stopover Zefram Cochrane's house while
returning Earth. The libmapi-0.9 COCHRANE release is born.

This libmapi-0.8 ROMULUS release is - similarly to previous releases -
a major step in understanding and implementing Microsoft Exchange
protocols. However it also includes MAPIProxy proxy server and a
(very) preliminary implementation of OpenChange Server providing
Exchange account creation from Outlook.
