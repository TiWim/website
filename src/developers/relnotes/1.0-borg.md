The OpenChange project team is happy to announce a new release (1.0
"Borg") is now available for download.

This release is designed to work with the "alpha 18" release of
Samba4.

OpenChange 1.0 provides a working server implementation with support
among other numerous features for cached mode and notifications (MAPI
but also from external services such as Dovecot). It is working with
all Outlook versions and is using SOGo backend for OpenChange as
primary storage backend for this release.

OpenChange client libraries have also been greatly improved with the
help of developers using it within their development (e.g.
evolution-mapi). See the `CHANGELOG` file in the tarball for full
details.

The team would like to thank everyone who helped in making this release,
including:

- Olly Betts
- Milan Crha
- Shaheed Haque
- Mathieu Patou
- Aaron Small
- Wolfgang Sourdeau

We'd also like to acknowledge the continued support of the Microsoft
"Dochelp" team - much appreciated.
