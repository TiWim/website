**The OpenChange project team is proud to announce the release of
OpenChange 2.1 QUADRANT**.  
<br/><br/> 
This maintenance release provides all latest fixes and builds against
Samba 4.1.7.

<br>

## Drop-in Compatibility for Microsoft Exchange ##

The OpenChange team has created the first and only compatible Free
Software implementation of Microsoft's Exchange protocols used by
Microsoft Outlook and compatible clients.

OpenChange runs as a service on top of Samba 4.0 Active Directory
compatible server and provides Exchange connectivity to all MAPI
compatible clients. The immediate benefit of OpenChange server is:

**No plugin required for Microsoft Outlook**

Another key feature of OpenChange lies in its capability to plug into
existing infrastructure and makes use of existing reliable
services. OpenChange makes use of your existing messaging server to
transmit (Postfix, Exim4) and deliver (Cyrus SASL or Dovecot)
emails. Regarding common groupware objects such as tasks, appointments
and notes, they are stored in your database server (PostgreSQL,
MySQL).

OpenChange server also provides support for Outlook Anywhere, formely
known as RPC over HTTP. This service allows clients using Microsoft
Outlook to connect to their Exchange servers from outside the corporate
network.

## Perfect software combination ##

using the following set of softwares.
