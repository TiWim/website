A new release of the MAPI library is now available for download. The
PHASER nickname obviously makes reference to the Star Trek mythic
weapon, but we took care to adjust our phasers on "paralyze" mode. This
release is a major step in comparison to libmapi-0.6. We have
implemented many new MAPI calls, have brought significant improvements
to the openchange tools, introduced a new library and last but not least
worked on making openchange easier to install.
