# Get Involved #

The OpenChange project welcomes anyone who would like to become
involved in the project. 

We particularly need people with an interest in (in alphabetically
order, not priority):

- bug triage
- development / coding in C, C++, Python (and possibly other languages
  depending on your development goals)
- documentation / proof reading
- system administration (especially with Exchange servers, although
  other mail / calendaring / task based tools and general sysadmin
  support would also be useful)
- testing and bug reporting

To become involved, we suggest you start by:

1. joining the main mailing list (see [subscription
information](http://mailman.openchange.org/listinfo/devel) and the
[archive of previous posts to the mailing
list](http://mailman.openchange.org/pipermail/devel/) for more
information)
2. [Register](http://tracker.openchange.org/account/register) on the tracker and post your questions in the [Forums](http://tracker.openchange.org/projects/openchange/boards).
3. and if possible, also join the [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel we use #openchange on [Freenode](http://freenode.net) (server: [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net), channel: [#openchange](irc://irc.freenode.net/openchange)).

Your next stage is then to set up a development environment (either
from scratch, or starting with a pre-build appliance). Guides on how
to do this are provided below. If you have trouble, please ask
questions on the IRC channel (preferred) or on the mailing list.

## Contribute to the Code ##

We have an incomplete list of tasks (including bugs to fix and
features to implement) on the [issue
tracker](http://tracker.openchange.org/projects/openchange/issues). Please
let us know what you are working on before getting too far into it, to
prevent any issues coming up at merge time, and also to allow us to
provide guidance / suggestions where appropriate.
