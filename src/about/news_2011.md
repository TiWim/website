**The OpenChange project team is happy to announce a new release (0.11 "Transporter") is now available for download.**

This release is designed to work with the *alpha 16* release of Samba4.  

OpenChange 0.11 provides improved Unicode handling, Kerberos
authentication, Fast Transfer, improved threading support and many,
many bug fixes.  See the CHANGELOG file in the tarball for full
details. This version does not provide server support (which is being
refactored, and will be a key part of the 1.0 development).

The team would like to thank everyone who helped in making this
release, including:

- Anatoliy Atanasov
- Reiner Bezuidenhout
- Milan Crha
- Sean Finney
- Kamen Mazdrashki
- David McCullough
- Wolfgang Sourdeau
- Philip Spencer
- Andrew Tridgell
  
We'd also like to acknowledge the continued support of the Microsoft
*Dochelp* team - much appreciated.
