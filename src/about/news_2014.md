The OpenChange project team will release a new version of OpenChange
on June 2014. This version will primarily be focused on merging one
large contribution from Zentyal, essential to our database storage
consolidation vision and new architecture possibilities. This release
will also improve NSPI addressbook stability, coverage of our unit
testing, API documentation and non developer documentation.

  <h2>OpenChange at SambaXp 2014</h2>

** From May 13th to 16th, 2014 **, OpenChange will participate to the
samba eXPerience conference in Göttingen (Germany). Julien Kerihuel
will present a talk entitled *Beyond Technical Fulfillment*.

In 2004 OpenChange was a few lines of code and no plan at all, and it
might have all stopped there. Over the next decade OpenChange slowly
gathered a contributor community and decided on a full implementation
of MAPI, client and server.  

Today in 2014, although there is plenty of enginering and polish to
complete, this goal has been achieved. Microsoft clients and servers
operate with full functionality against OpenChange without being able
to tell the difference. But what should come next? This talk explains
the kinds of interesting and new things that can be done when you
implement the world's most popular groupware solution in open source
code.

Zentyal Server development is strongly focused on providing a native
replacement for both Microsoft® Active Directory and Microsoft®
Exchange Server. The continuous integration of OpenChange in its
product along with its regular contributions to the project have lead
to major improvements in the area of webmail and usability.

This fully new webmail user interface (UI) (based on the SOGo webmail)
will be included in the Zentyal Server 3.4 version that will be
released on March 15 and is available for beta testing as of
today. For additional information and preview, check out this Zentyal
Labs article that highlights the main changes and includes several
screenshots.
