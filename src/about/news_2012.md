  <h2>OpenChange 1.0 BORG Released!</h2>
  <div class="date">Wednesday, 14th March 2012</div>
<img border="0" width="96" height="96" style="border: 0pt none; margin: -5px 5px 5px; float: left;" alt="" src="/images/icon_openchange_logo.png" />**The OpenChange project team is happy to announce a new release [(1.0 &quot;Borg&quot;)](http://tracker.openchange.org/projects/openchange/files) is now available for download.**

<p style="text-align: justify;">This release is designed to work with the &quot;alpha 18&quot; release of Samba4. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OpenChange 1.0 provides a working server implementation with support among other numerous features for cached mode and notifications (MAPI but also from external services such as Dovecot). It is working with all Outlook versions and is using SOGo backend for OpenChange as primary storage backend for this release.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OpenChange client libraries have also been greatly improved with the help of developers using it within their development (e.g. evolution-mapi).&nbsp;See the CHANGELOG file in the tarball for full details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team would like to thank everyone who helped in making this release, including:</p>
