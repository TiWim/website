**We are proud to share with you the first preview of the successful
 OpenChange-SOGo partnership.**

 For the last 2 months, the SOGo and OpenChange development teams have
 been working together on a proof of concept server code designed to
 change for real the way people use groupware solutions.

SOGo and OpenChange are converging. We are using the best of our
technology to provide the first real Open Source and Microsoft
Exchange interoperable groupware solution users have been waiting for:

- OpenChange Server is a transparent and native Exchange replacement
  for Microsoft Outlook users working on top of Samba 4. With
  OpenChange, you don't need costly MAPI connectors anymore.
- SOGo is a reliable groupware server with a focus on scalability and
  open standards. Let your Mozilla Thunderbird/Lightning, Apple
  iCal/iPhone, BlackBerry and now Microsoft Outlook users collaborate
  using a modern platform.
 
The following video shows the growing power of OpenChange and SOGo model:

1. E-Mails are stored on an IMAP server
2. Calendar and Contacts are stored in SOGo backend and edited through
  SOGo Ajax-based Web interface
3. Messages, events, tasks and contacts are directly exposed to
  Microsoft Outlook through OpenChange server and its mapistore
  storage component

On June 1st 2010, GNOME Evolution MAPI team has integrated OpenChange
Free/Busy feature into their master tree. Evolution now shows all the
Busy, Tentative and Out of Office times for the user. Evolution is now
also able to fetch and subscribe to public folders.

<h2>OpenChange and SOGo</h2>
<div class="date">Tuesday, 15th June 2010</div>
<img border="0" width="96" height="96" style="border: 0pt none; margin: -5px 5px 5px; float: left;" alt="" src="/images/icon_sogo.png" />

SOGo is a groupware server with a focus on scalability and open
standards ([http://www.sogo.nu](http://www.sogo.nu)) which provides
business logic for all the different type of messages OpenChange is
dealing with (e-mail, calendaring, tasks, notes etc.).

The SOGo and OpenChange teams have started discussions on a future PoC
which would implement a SOGo mapistore provider for OpenChange
server. OpenChange server would handle the Outlook clients
connectivity through MAPI and store/retrieve data from SOGo.

It also means Outlook users would then be able to fully collaborate
with there SOGo, Mozilla Thunderbird/Lighning, Apple iCal and Gnome
Evolution.

<h2>OpenChange at SambaXP 2010</h2>
<div class="date">Friday, 5th March 2010</div>
<img border="0" width="96" height="96" style="border: 0pt none; margin: -5px 5px 5px; float: left;" alt="" src="/images/samba_logo.png" />

**From May 5th to 7th, 2010**, OpenChange will participate to the
  samba eXPerience conference in GÃ¶ttingen (Germany). Julien Kerihuel
  will present a talk entitled OpenChange: Ambitious ace of spades.

FLOSS developers working on closed source solutions replacement are in
many aspects similar to magicians. First, they both try to understand
and reproduce existing routines. Finally when the secret is revealed,
they try to figure out a way to improve or revolutionize it and take
it to the next level.

This parallel will be used along the talk to illustrate OpenChange
progresses since last SambaXP: MAPI development libraries and
OpenChange server status, impact of Exchange documentation on
development, etc.

**OpenChange at linux.conf.au 2010!**

Jelmer Vernooij and Brad Hards from the OpenChange project will be
convening a "Birds of a Feather" or BoF session at linux.conf.au
2010. The OpenChange BoF will be held 15:45 - 16:30 on Friday 22
January 2010.

We'll be answering questions and showing off the latest state of
OpenChange. For more information, check the linux.conf.au 2010
website, and add your notes to the OpenChange BoF page

We'd like to see lots of you there! However if you can't make the BoF
session, or have something you'd like to discuss, we'll both be
attending the conference, and shouldn't be too hard to find.
