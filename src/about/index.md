**OpenChange provides a portable Open Source implementation of Microsoft
Exchange Server and Exchange protocols.**

Exchange is a groupware server designed to work with Microsoft
Outlook, and providing features such as a messaging server, shared
calendars, contact databases, public folders, notes and tasks.

## Exchange Protocols Interoperability ##

This is the MAPI library development purpose (libmapi). MAPI stands
for Messaging Application Programming Interface and is used within
Microsoft Exchange.

The OpenChange implementation provides a client-side library which can
be used in existing messaging clients and offer native compatibility
with Exchange server and OpenChange server. Novell Gnome Evolution and
KDE Akonadi (KMail, Mailody) are using the OpenChange MAPI library to
access Microsoft Exchange servers natively.

## Transparent replacement to Microsoft Exchange Server ##

** This basically means that OpenChange server doesn't need any plugin
   installation in Outlook.**

The server is tighly linked to Samba4 since it is developed as an
endpoint module for smbd (the samba server daemon).

The project was founded in 2003 at EPITECH by Julien Kerihuel in the
context of his Epitech Innovative Project. Julien is the project
manager, lead developer. The OpenChange team is now made up Samba, KDE
and volunteered developers.

Without the Samba4 folks and the amazing work they have been doing
since past years, it would certainly not have been possible to achieve
most of the work we have done.
