OpenChange has been integrated in the [Zentyal Linux small business
server](http://www.zentyal.org)</a> project, making it possible to
carry out an OpenChange deployment through Zentyal Server's graphical
user interface in only 3 minutes. The first technology preview of this
integration will be discussed and showcased at the [Zentyal Summit
2013](http://summit.zentyal.com), that is to be held in Zaragoza
(Spain) on the 3rd and 4th of October.

<br/>
During the event, Julien Kerihuel (CTO of Zentyal and Lead developer
of OpenChange) will deliver a technical overview of the integration as
well as a technical workshop of the OpenChange project. Moreover,
Ignacio Correas (CEO of Zentyal) will discuss the commercial
opportunities Zentyal-OpenChange integration offers. The first
technology preview, that will be available for download since the 3rd
of October, is also made available for testing in the demo space of
the event. Check out the [program](http://summit.zentyal.com/program/)
for further details.

The Zentyal Summit 2013, held under the slogan "Keep Calm and Go
Hybrid", will focus specially on how to seamlessly replace Microsoft
Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange based solutions and what
alternatives allow SMBs to keep their local IT infrastructure, while
adapting cloud-solutions according to their needs. The event is aimed
at current and potential Zentyal partners, customers, community
members and Zentyal Server users. There is no registration fee and the
event will be transmitted on-line, but
[registration](http://summit.zentyal.com/register/) is compulsory.
